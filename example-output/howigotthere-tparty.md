At the end - not my writing career
And I heard , which was also the author of I have been, for two days, before I was fully self-employed for over eight years ;
The educational train - Wreck
How to properly operate and waaay too early for the best English schoolkids .
I already knew ( from an early age - 12 or so) that I wanted bytpisatelem SF.
Given my notes , I studied English literature.
You 're probably wondering why I did not go into the calculation .
So : what to do ?
So I sealed my fate for the next seven years.
What followed is ... irrelevant.
The price was clear Six months in the staffing of a hole in the wall decrepit Halifax, when local detectives received a hot tip and saw my workplace by armed robbers twice in one month.
What can I say?
However, I finally figured out , have a career as a national authorized dealer support writing habits is a terrible misunderstanding.
Catching the bug
I type in the manual portable typewriter self-study, 12-16 years old , typewriter death - metal fatigue fracture begins.
These latter, who in the sedition, which I omitted in the computation , which is from me out of the men drive away .
I was , I think she has a small computer -mad from the moment I first saw in 1977 , a Commodore PET in a shop window , I would not be the only one in my generation ;
ZX -81 sucked .
Autumn of 1985 , when I a pharmacy degree , which, when Amstrad PCW 8256 was the word processing began started my third year .
Well, that was not to say that I ignore the whole home computing for tours .
My interest in computers was waiting because I was studying a challenging course and I have not had the time or money to spend on other entertainment.
AlePCW function needs .
I also focused on writing fiction.
But I digress : this piece is not about writing , it's about other things.
There is a word processor , and be satisfied, I might stop there , some programmers , if not in the now-defunct software company subtle supervision.
Most of the time , most people do not need to know how many words you have typed .
Within 48 hours after getting my PCW out of the box and the installation of the plug , I had the boot disk turned and bent over Mallard BASIC manual , trying to get my head around how to read to get a file.
By the time I sold the PCW and my first real PC updated (18 months later , on the back of receipts from my first post - graduate , post-registration job as a pharmacist ) had twice as much RAM as I
In 1988 , the habit of PC had bitten me hard .
Our idea is that if you already have a decent science degree , you can go back and live in the undergraduate degree in computer science grants to universities and local staff , the Chief Secretary for Administration will lay down your head is equivalent to 12 months.
In 1989 , I was desperate to get out of the pharmacy - in the end , I became a sommervikarjobbtre weeks before term , due to being physically unable to think of going in to work .
... I went blind in one eye .
Oh yes .
I swear, I did not read any fiction after six months, when I started this process.
You go to university.
I said I did not have time to read any fiction for six months ;
But all the good times came to an end .
And then , when my employment history was really weird ...

In early 1988 , I bought a small apartment .
There was Collateral damage , of course.
And so ...
This ... is a newly-minted graduate with no track record in the IT industry to do?
My incoherent memory luckily dimmer residual trauma of milk round interviews ;
Case in point : British directory for shopping and see something \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Imperial goods jestpodział occupies several floors of the great sandstone Victorian building , in a valley, near Forster Square railway station .
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Mr. Y nodded blankly .


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
At this point, alarm bells started ringing in my head.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
At this point a vision of my life in the next world flashed through my head, and it was not pretty , full of frolicking kittens and rainbows.
I do not think I said \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
First start-up death march
There is no work of three-piece suits and holding mainframe .
Already in 1980 , a British computer magazine scene was very lively.
While I bylbezdenezhny Comp.

Today, with 20/20 hindsight , I recognize RWG for what it was;
RWG was not the first start of Graham.
I'm not clear, how , what, or a fracture of IO Graham, who has injured the other , and the world , through him, the time of the 1988 graphics.
RWG 's mission is to sell RISC-based parallel graphics processors , the company received a Silicon Graphics Corporation and Evans and Sutherland is equivalent to the introduction of a similar system , specialized rendering hardware .
If hardware Graham was bright and impressive , the company that produced it was more a case of the mouse that roared .
( In an attempt to start a business so that it has been given to the design , if the ruler of the mouse, # 1 : I will not die, unless the elephant elephants the ecosystem .)
The problem with the development of graphics cards is that customers need software to run on them.
And that boss polegaból .
I learned shortly after my arrival in GTR that things were not going well .
That does not mean that GTR did not have exceptional talent.
Programmeringsmiljøvar ... tense, focused, and a little weird, even at startup standards.
Anyway, I was in the RWG about eight months , when he came to work early in the morning to hear a line of bubbles coming from the office of Graham .
The company was not insolvent yet .
With some regret , that he shot his resume - and got the interview successful R \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
A success ... OEM UNIX called Santa Cruz Operation .

I spent nearly three and a half years of work on the technical documentation for the vendor UNIX in the early 90s.
SCO does not tojedzenie zombie brain UNIX world , strange though it may seem for young \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
By the end of 1991, when I not only SCO Xenix SCO .
(If you are scratching your head and wondering why it does not sound like the SCO Group, which jestprzedmiotem so much hatred these days, it is because it is not the same company . SCO Group started as Caldera Systems, Utah-
When I answered advertising technology writer, I have nothing, I went to a lot of ideas.

I eyeballed the Wyse terminal in the office for her.
Bridget gave me a very strange look : he byćpierwszy of many.
With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I did not fit in too well in the SCO ;
Technology wise ... I think they are not interested , so I'll keep it short : eat your own dogfood .
At SCO , I admit that I went a little wild.
The trouble with the creep of the mission , from my point of view, which is used in accordance with the Law of Parkinson's ;
In the early 90s , one of the perennial headache in the department techpubs SCO received a permanent solution.
The solution we came up with was called HTML , SGML some fun coming led Markup Language that client-server platform called , ambitiously , the World Wide Web.
Did I say \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
I confess , the Web has fascinated me .
During one of my periods of burn out, I decided to teach myself Perl.
All good times come to an end .
In early 1995 he had been doing some work on the side;
One morning , our head of any instructions from the hive cabinet , removing all prints Dilbert stitched with beige fabric walls , and tells everyone to be ready for the magical mystery tour , leaving from the courtyard on the first afternoon.
Now I 've learned over the years , Bad Signs in assessing the health of a company.

It byłafirma UNIX on a computer at a critical juncture in its development.
Do I need to explain why putting the accountant is responsible for the company's technology is not necessarily a wise , visionary and forward-looking step?
At this point I considered notice.
As a California software company , SCO has been subjected to different types of management of American diseases;
I am perhaps unfairly critical here ;
I closed nosily the book and read the flyleaf .

An example of a terminally bad sign for any organization in the field of computer science:
... When it turns out that reading manuals sports jest1980 IBM services .
This may not make much sense to you if you are from outside of the computer biz , but let's put it this way : IBM was the company that grew fat and happy catering to people like those at Imperial Merchandise .
The second start-up death march
Or ... how usenet I got a job ...
The World Wide Web is the Internet.
Who then went to work on my second attempt , the death march ...
( One thing I 'd better make it clear at this stage is that I always drink with people in this part of the memory, still living in the same city, so I 'm inclined to pee in the paddling pool
Okay : let back clock with SCO disappear in the territory of the twilight zone at the beginning of 1995, return to the halcyon days in the mid and late 1993 .
I wanted to be on the internet at home.
The modem at home during byłnieco strangely odd ;
Among the people I met over a pint of beer that night was Fearghas .
I was not the first rent -F for ;
I arrived about a week after Libby and Dave -戴维利than being processed admin and another programmer ( and, later , my boss 's chief technology officer , he Datacash effect ) .
It took me a week to find a place to live, from what I fall in the open bedroom F is .

After about six months FMA was bursting at the seams .
I have very little creative writing done during this time.
Then, as I was busy on a long board together (trying to implement a web search for Hampshire County Council, who , in a fit of future unusual mind had splurged a quarter
Despite all the small contract jobs , FMA bread and butter was still the great Demon gig .
That fateful encounter spelled disaster for the FMA .
Disaster , in other words, had struck .
goes freelance
Generally, your employer go tits up at the end of the month without a payday bag in sight is a bad experience.
This is what happened to me between the collapse and the formation of FMA Ltd Datacash Ltd ...
Or, the Inland Revenue , who loves pain of itself, because it is pain , the time will be used , such motion , which is the year the sideline invoices , or resources to order one.
Nieduszy - - These things sięponowna Rate doing with my life Cotycholery looking for cancer of the road or the death of a loved one, but still : I knew I wanted to be a writer .
I took a hard look at what I was doing since 1986, when I left the university, and I realized that I had made a balls - up complete with everything .
Accordingly, while working on WebShield , I started working on a new novel in my spare time - and short stories .
By the time WebShield was done, I had more work on the horizon , and had decided that I liked this whole contract programmer Gig kind .
He that is far from being obvious State Department internal cat.
I was hired by the tech arc -head Clive Feather , widoczniewłaściciel (if I remember correctly) , write a web front-end for the registration wizard online with Microsoft Windows 98 does not jestużytkownikiem Windows (I
You know the joke about the reward for a job well done is another job ?
After that, I spent a few months, this is my opinion there is nothing wrong with Dorking is not fixed.
In any case , at work , but done.
In this case , the clash of ideas Demon - between Clive neat gee - whiz tech idea about how to implement an interface to the Microsoft Enrollment and web and design folks ' idea of ​​how to implement a public- facing forwards to
Of course, if something is wrong , that is the most convenient to point the finger of guilt at the guy , you do not have to work every day .
Moreover, I had indeed become .
Initially , the first on the road
The life of an IT industry contractor is an unstable one .
Or so you think ...
Let's back the clock to April / May 1995, when he fled screaming SCO arms and landed in the attic in Edinburgh , on a desk between sauna cabins and ski rack .
A client who hired Dave byłspecjalistyczny outfit called information publications, publications .
These days, it routinely our credit cards to work on the internet without any particular fuss or bother ;
In 1995 , the only solution they could find - for some of the UK clearingbanker- was a package that ran on a Windows PC.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
And so I found myself in a pub in Leith one day , listening to the pitch Dave .
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Now , I can not honestly say that I did the right thing , because as it happened , the activity of Dave told me that he went to the exchange via a reverse takeover in early 2000 , but it was not turning down the chance to be
Oh , and the pay deal Dave was offering amounted to 50 % of salary compared to my freelance contractor status.
What do you think?
A few weeks later , I started working for Dave and Gavin .
Now I am not, by the base , inclination or training , a banker.
The banking sector is different in different countries.
Credit was not a British invention , but came to the UK shortly after its introduction in the United States.
Given APACS protocol specification , any electronic music will lead to fundamental point of sale terminals and software, you can use the modem to dial the bank's authorization server and get an authorization code or credit card denied message back.
You already know that sound too good to be true , right?
Well, he was.
The beginning of May that little -Up
The Red Queen Race: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
In late 1997 , I signed on as a contractor for Gavin and Dave new venture.
Imagine this: you're sharing a small office - about the size of two cabins - with another guy .
The demo is a big ball of Perl talk to a mSQL database (MySQL had yet to show up ) and a Web server.
DataCash was launched in the period of pre Christmas season 1997 , transaction management for about half a dozen stores.
Still it was a qualified success.
Piece of cake .
1998 was a painful experience.
Gavin ( which is understandable , since the decade -Added perspective) began selling DataCash odget -GO .
Another major problem in the early days was that the banks had got no idea about this internet thing .
Data for Cash approved for connection to a network of banks , we had to go to the bank to get a diploma.
Question: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
A: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Q : \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
A: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Q : \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Now , one of the truisms of software engineering as a field that version 2.0 of any program sucks.
DataCash 2.0 was interference in spades .
On a certain night in the praises of in the 1998 , adding a developer to create pieces - It is right outside the Barclays Bank on the support of the first, if I well remember.
Those who are in the midst of , in the 2008 , which is moved, where, among other things, to do the same ... in the morning, the fire of the Victorian
Now , the bankers and information technology : is there a reason why I do not engage in internet banking.
Banks are traditionally ( forget all the credit default swap voodoo nonsense ) in risk management.
Consider this mind set for a moment.
Now , in British retail banking in the 1980s and 1990s - this is a whole different kettle of fish from investment banking - there was a career well understood.
I have not worked in a bank IT department , but I had to go with them on a day - the current business for a few years .
There were exceptions , of course.
But for the most part , IT Banking - at least in 1990 - did not have a clue about the Internet .
Into the singularity
The man in the forest .
Let me qualify that remark.
Sometimes at the end of 1998, DataCash , the start- up I worked , started going exponential .
At the end of 1997 he started ropey demo and about five customers .
In March-April 98 , if I remember correctly , we had a production system with errors , which had been rushed into service ahead of time ... but we could deal with two banks instead of one , and we support a lot of additional features
Sometime during this period I wrote what was basically a clone of limited functionality expect in Perl.
( I gather that DataCash emeryturęostatni code worked for a time in 2008, when he left the company in 2000, I contemplate this news with mixed feelings. Fiction \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
I started thinking 1997 summer outdoor .
1998 years byłpunktem , com żebańki really started to inflate .
In the year , for a light is shot .
For most of the end of 1998 and the first half of 1999 , the final borders of the bane of my life byłazależna ecommerce Paribas Bank called KLELine .
We were in the early to mid-1999 , we had approximately four banks up and running, and another three or four in the pipeline to link up and become certified.
A particularly bad Wednesday I came into work, did things until I Redlined , then sat at my desk for an hour.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
I emailed my partner is booked return tickets to Amsterdam and a weekend at our favorite hotel there .
Then my cell phone.

It was applause - from the rest of the office - that convinced me not to send in his resignation by e-mail .
The pub we bathed in , incidentally, is the Cafe de Wildeman .
Then on Sunday we flew home , and it was shortly after this that Dave was able to push his hand in signing on as an employee , not a contractor ;
The music stops
I do not remember much about 1999 ;
I know I was there , the body : I remember in 1998 , I'm here, if I did not in 1999 , but in 1999 the life itself is wrapped in mystery today , dark chocolate coating mysterious puzzles coating does not
In my spare time , I wrote \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
Free time, which I did not have much.
One day, Dave asked me to write my list of things to do and email it to him.
Given this pressure, it should not surprise you to learn something broke.
In 1999, there was a kind of panic on the year 2000 problem .
New York between 1999 and 1997 the Y2K Datacash , what they can do , what?
printf ( \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
I should have looked like this :

Time ... lorem.
Batch File reconciliation ... that was even more mysterious , but more of a toxic danger lurking , and closer to killing DataCash in the early days than Y2K ever came .
When you hand over your credit or debit card to a store clerk with EPOS terminal, several things happen to disappear from your bank account and the money will appear in the shop between the invoice.
Later , probably sometime around midnight EPOS terminal (which keeps a journal file all day transaction) goes online to talk to another bank computer.
Now the bit you do not see : the race batchfile central unit generates an output report , which describes (hopefully) what you just did , and what the total number of credit card transactions are processed correctly
Got that?
DataCash increases exponentially at this time.
In any case , as we passed five customers , and we found that the processing of thousands of transactions through half a dozen different banks at night , headache batchfile reconciliation began to emerge as a critical issue .
Payment service providers need different types of traders report.
Job - by the end of 1999 -Files data received poorly coordinated - but very labor intensive.
Unravel that particular mess my relationship with Gavin permanently acidic ( CEO , remember) ;
The angel of Datacash had purchased an interest in a recruitment company executives who were officers in high -level position with other companies - the kind of headhunters who needed just finish five to ten slots
A seemingly endless series of empty clothes in odd niches on what passed for our organization ;
DataCash went public in January 2000 - with capitalization of something like 32 million L - and everything came up shirt .
About five years ago , in another Internet bubble circuit Edinburgh acquaintance had tried to recruit me.
So it was that in late January or early February 2000 David went to visit and in no uncertain terms , bridges burned .
But the bad news arrived .
But as for me ... there I was, relaxing at home and the growing storm clouds gathered above bad news.
I was about to raise now.
The end of the beginning
The style of cyberpunk life reads much better in the fiction of an apparent lifestyle .
For this is in thee , which had previously drug dealer hacking for a living.
But I digress ...
In March 2000 , I realized that I have a problem : what was that I resigned from my previous job with extreme prejudice as I was going to join the company crashed and burned in the middle of the whole industry conflagration
Back in 1998, Jeremy Spencer asked me to write a monthly column for the magazine Computer Shopper , and then # 2 and # 3 best-selling monthly computer kiosk in the UK.
Lorem indicates the author of the report , except of course the main body of the magazine , in the - to stand the monthlies pay ( or not , if a man - which before its publication, cannibalised the text) who
Summer 2000 was the year when three new kiosks Linux magazines launched in the UK , and I was on them like a flea at a dog show .
In the meantime, I am also told to do some small book .
And then there was Ben Jeapes and great engine .
To cut short - the wheels grind slowly publication - about six months , Ben sent me a contract for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
( This is my bio -tech , do not write my biography , so I'm not going to explain that here . Lets say I have had terrible luck with the agents , but the third time was the lucky charm appointment . )
Great contracted Caitlin during the lifetime of Milo, which, being built is - right as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
All this in the future , though.
Andrew dot -COM was bombed , but he had ideas on start- up .
IBM in 2000 was a very different company from the IBM 1980 , which staff had to shout driven me to work with SCO.
Well, to start planning for the back seat to make a living .
September 12, 2001 .
So there you have it: the punchline to a long shaggy dog ​​story that my story careers in the industry.
This meeting was ... well, the topic of conversation was rather overshadowed by the events of the previous day .
It byłprawdopodobnienajlepszy result .
