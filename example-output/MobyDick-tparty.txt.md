Nothing more happened on the passage worthy of mention ;
well run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.

Nantucket!

CHAPTER 15. Chowder .


It was quite late in the evening , a little tight Moss gdyprzyszedł

business that day , at least none but one supper and a bed.
the Spouter - Inn had recommended to his cousin Hosea Hussey of
Try Pots, which shows one znajlepiej sięwłaściciel

Hosea , as he called him , was famous for his chowders .
hinted at that which now he can not do better than to try the fortune of the pot - is to present thyself approved

we finally came, something that it can not be denied .

one for Queequeg , and one for me.
First whaling port;
I am in the chapel of whalemen men;

I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with
Iżółta hair yellow dress standing on the porch of the inn , in
a dull red pendant lamp there, that looked very much like an injured eye ,
and carrying on a quick scolding with a man in a purple woolen shirt .





Therefore it was concluded
Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to perform all their affairs .
known our desires for a supper and a bed , Mrs. Hussey , postponing further
scolding for the moment, took us to a small room and bathroom
us at a table scattered with remnants of a recently concluded repast ,
they turned to us and said -

We resumed business ;
And for me , I wonder if it's here , there is no impact on the head?
What does this tell ootuplyayuschey chowder -headed people?

CHAPTER 16.Korabl.


In bed we came up with our plans for the future.
no small concern , Queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been
Yojo -pilne consultations on behalf of their god little black dress - and Yojo
had told him two or three times , and strongly insisted on it
every point , that instead of going our set between the whaling fleet
In the harbor , and in concert selecting our craft ;
Yojo honestly nakazaławybór board must be fully
with me because Yojo thought befriend us ;
had fired on a ship, which, if left to myself , I , Ishmael ,
should be infallibly , for all the world as if it was shot
by chance,
It does not depend on Queequeg.

I forgot to mention that Queequeg placed in many things, large
confidence in the quality of judgment and surprising forecast Yojo 's
of things ;
god of sorts, perhaps meant well enough on the whole, but in all
cases , it may not be good projects .

Now , this plan Queequeg, or Yojo, touch selection

Queequeg is forced ;
Reach a decision ordering the dynamic energy industry

early, leaving Queequeg shut Yojo in our small bedroom - for
it seemed that it was sort of Lent or Ramadan , albodzień , fasting ,
humiliation and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day ;
Not to learn, but it is used several times
I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles - leaving Queequeg ,
then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe and Yojo warming himself at his
sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.

As Queequeg and I are now made ​​pretty in this business of whaling in attack ;

All my anxiety unfair to convince you that you landsmen, hereby

But there was another and more vital practical influences at work.
Even at the present day has the original prestige Sperm Whale ,
Because other types of marine animals and terrible difference

CHAPTER 42. The whiteness of the whale.


What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ;
was for me as yet remains unsaid .

In addition to these obvious reasons touching Moby Dick , which
can not , but sometimes awaken in the soul of each person some interest ,

sometimes by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest ;

Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that

Chapter 62. The Dart .


The word in connection with an incident in the last chapter.

According to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale - boat

known as the harpooner - oars.

All that is allowed , this is in the country, in fifty whalemen
fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ;
which is in constant day and harpooneers cursed , and is mad ;
of them actually burst their blood vessels in the boat ;
some sperm whalemen absent four years with four barrels ;
that for many ship owners, whaling is a concern, but lost ;
harpooneer makes the trip , and if you take a breath with his
body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !

Again, if the dart is successful, then the second critical moment,
ie , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooner
also starts from the front and from the rear , an imminent threat

The second , which is in the way , and the ship ,

Now, I do not care who maintains the opposite, but all this is both foolish

the most important and fascinating in this story is this : was

Similar to Perseus and Andromeda adventures - indeed, by some alleged

That shag - ports (which comes in the name ), he convinced his
lack of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something dark in
Regard to its adhesive body and gastric juices of the whale.
This objection also falls to the ground , because the German exegetist
supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
Dead whale - as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
their dead horses , tents and crawled into them.
guessed by other continental commentators , that when Jonah was thrown
overboard from the Joppa ship, immediately he made his escape to
another ship nearby, some whale ship on drawing the head ;

another reason for his lack of faith.
Law: Jonah was swallowed by a whale in the Mediterranean Sea , and
after three days he was thrown up somewhere within three days
of Nineveh , a city on the Tigris , a lot more than three days
across the road from the nearest point on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.

But there is no other way to land on whales prophet
